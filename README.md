# hevo2020-to-vzbot-conversion
This repository contains the files needed to convert a HyperCube Evolution 2020 into a VzBot


## I. Introduction
The goal of the conversion is to reuse as much parts from a HyperCube Evolution 2020 (HEVO 2020) into a VzBot. The frame was for a HyperCube but has been reused into a HEVO 2020 and has now been reused to build a VzBot. Since the VzBot uses linear rails instead of linear rods, the linear rods on the X and Y axis will be used for a different project.


## II. Parts to be reused

  1. 2020 Aluminum Extrusion (bundled HyperCube frame from Zyltech)
    - 6x 440mm
    - 4x 400mm

  2. CR10s heated bed
  3. optical endstop
  4. 4x 12mm linear rod 400mm
  5. Mean Well LLRS-350-24
  6. BTT SKR v1.3
  7. Raspberry Pi 3b+
  8. Fysetc mini heat bed module
